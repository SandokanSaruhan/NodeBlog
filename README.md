Installation
------------

### Node.js

You can download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

Copy code

`npm -v`

If you see a version number printed to the console, then npm is installed.

Once you have an account, follow these steps:

-------------

Before you can run the application, you'll need to configure it with your MongoDB Atlas credentials.

1.  Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
2.  Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following lines:

`MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>`

1.  Replace `<your-mongodb-uri>` with your MongoDB Atlas connection string. You can find your connection string by following these steps:

    1.  Log in to your MongoDB Atlas account.
    2.  Navigate to the cluster that you created earlier.
    3.  Click the "Connect" button.
    4.  Select "Connect your application".
    5.  Select "Node.js" as the driver and "3.6 or later" as the version.
    6.  Copy the connection string that is displayed on the page.

    Your connection string should look something like this:
